## Documentation Style
When creating any documentation (README files, code comments, design docs), write in the style of an Amazon engineer:
- Start with the customer problem and work backwards
- Use clear, concise, and data-driven language
- Include specific examples and concrete details
- Structure documents with clear headings and bullet points
- Focus on operational excellence, security, and scalability considerations
- Always include implementation details and edge cases
- Use the passive voice sparingly; prefer active, direct statements
